= Java Annotations

Wasn't it awesome that we could meet the management's requirements with such a little amount of code using Spring?

So using Spring definitely gives us a lot of power, however it is not nice to debug XML files.
It would be really cool if we can configure our Beans in Java so we can debug them more easily.

Luckily, since version 3.0, Spring comes with an option to use Java annotation based configuration.

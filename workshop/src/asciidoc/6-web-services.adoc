= Web Services

As you've seen in the previous exercises, Spring is not exclusively meant for web projects.
However it is where it became the most popular.
The reason for this is that without a framework like Spring it is much harder to set up a web service in Java yourself.
You have to implement so called Servlets in order to be able to handle HTTP requests.
Spring implements a servlet called the DispatcherServlet, the DispatcherServlet abstracts a lot of the difficulty of Java servlets away from you.
This way you can handle HTTP requests by simply using annotations in your Java code just like we did in the previous exercise.

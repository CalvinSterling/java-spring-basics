= JDBC

Cool, we made a REST API for our books, however our API is not much use if we don't actually store the data.

Java has a library called `JDBC` (Java Database Connectivity).
JDBC lets you manage database connections in a database-independent way.
This is nice, because this way your application does not depend on a specific type of database.
It is always good to prevent this kind of dependency so you can easily switch over to a different type of database.
At some point you might want to change to a different database, for instance because it performs better for your use case or because it is cheaper.
If you didn't use JDBC but something database specific, it will be much more work to migrate.
